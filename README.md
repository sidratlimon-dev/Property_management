### Cloning Process

1. After cloning the repository, create an **`images`** folder in your project directory. Ensure that the folder path is correctly linked to the application to avoid any issues with asset loading.

2. **Note**: Due to Git's file size limitations, we were unable to upload image assets as a single zip file. Therefore, all images were uploaded individually to maintain compatibility and accessibility.

3. Once the folder is created, place the image files in the **`images`** folder to maintain the expected directory structure.

4. Other than this step, the cloning and setup process remains unchanged. Follow the provided installation and configuration guidelines to get started.
